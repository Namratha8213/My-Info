<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Namratha, a student studying Information Science Engineering at NMAM Institute of Technology. 
  Besides my pursuits I have a range of hobbies that keep me busy. 
  These include dancing, singing, solving problems and capturing the beauty of nature through photography.
   There's always something to explore and learn! </p>

<p>When it comes to discussing my personal life during childhood, I must admit that I was never an exceptional student. 
  Instead, I was merely average. However, I had a great passion for Bharathanatayam and had completed my junior grade when I was in 8th grade.
  This achievement gave me a boost of confidence, and I began to work harder in my studies.
   After completing my 12th grade, I enrolled in engineering at the NMAM Institute of Technology in Nitte Karkala.
    Currently, I am in my second year of the program.
</p>

<p>I have a deep passion for web development and coding.
  Creating digital solutions and solving complex problems through code brings me immense joy. 
  Besides, I am dedicated to improving my leadership and communication skills.
  I believe they are crucial for effective collaboration and becoming a well-rounded professional.
  My goal is not only to excel as a coder but also to inspire and lead others through my technical expertise and commitment to continuous growth.</p>
